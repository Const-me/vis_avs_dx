-francis:
added floor(), ceil() and $Phi
added "cancel fullscreen on deactivation" toggle option

-mig:
added example infrastructure to dmove.  :)
now there are 8 examples in dmove.  also tuned up my beat-interpolation algos!  woo!

-justin
added blend modes to misc / buffer save
made config expand trees by default

-mig:
started work on undo/redo system.
infrastructure seems to work, but I can't figure out the magical
  incantation to make the UI reflect the newly altered render list
  although it seems to actually go back to the last values in the renderer.
"Do you want to save?" dirty flag now contained (mostly) in the undo object.
(In fact, it saves a dirty bit for every undo state, so you can undo twice,
  save, then redo and you should have your dirty bit still set.  If you then
  undo yet again, you're back to what you saved and you have no dirty bit)
added more examples to SuperScope

-justin:
fixed memory leak in evallib stuff I made a bit back
added debug window, moved register watch to it, added error listing
added option for clear variables on recompile in debug window
fixed bugs, too.

-justin:
started adding setting for reinit on edit for evallib stuff
made config change detection a little more accurate
made superscope/dmove/shift/etc reinit on edit work right
made trans / movement only replace usereval with preseteval if editted
fyi: trans / movement also provides 'sw' and 'sh' for screen width and height,
  so things like 'd=d*0.93 + (((x*sw/2)&(y*sh/2)&1)*-0.3);' are fun :)
fixed trans / movement backwards compatible stuff (no crashy at least)
updated eval documentation stuff, need people to write docs for it, too.. heheh
lots of ui cleanups (more edit room!)
fixed some fullscreen new fbresize bugs
updated fullscreen overlay mode some
updated maximum local variables to 256 from 64 
added global registers [reg00,reg01,... reg99] for debug 
  and effect synchronization (or inter-preset communication) 
added global register watch in root list window (for debugging) 
added comments for eval code. // and /* bla */ 
updated eval documentation 
added gettime() function to eval 
made annoying grey rectangle below tree go away when you aren't docked 
added new color modifier effect, which can be used to replace 
  (with script) a lot of different effects (and be faster and more flexible). 
added 'minimum blend' mode for effect lists/line drawing 
added 'round up' option for Blur. 
made a generic avs directory scanner routine for subdirs (yay!)
   made it only generate menus when opened, for speed
made effects that use evallib reset variables to empty on recompile
made avs track dirtiness of presets, and (optionally) prompt to save etc
made avs resize images when resizing (optionally)
added extended APE interface, that lets you access evallib, global registers,
  line blend/width modes. (see apesdk.zip)

- basu: added 'onbeat enabled' option to lists
- christophe: added thread priority settings (so you can set avs in idle prority while keeping winamp in
  high prio.)
