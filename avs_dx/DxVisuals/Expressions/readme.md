Effects like dynamic move, superscope, and a few others allow users to write expression code in the AVS editor. Apparently, the expression language is called NSEEL, I guess the acronym is for NullSoft Effects Expression Language.Original AVS implemented a JIT compiler, these expressions were compiled into legacy x87 instructions. I wanted expressions to run on GPU so I had to do something else instead. Besides, I didn’t like their stack much, they use GNU Bison from 1985, almost as old as I am.Microsoft no longer supports authoring shaders in assembly. It’s technically possible, I did in one project to inject my code in the shaders I didn’t have source code for.But it’s unsupported, and relatively hard to accomplish, especially producing the correct [signature chunks](http://timjones.io/blog/archive/2015/09/02/parsing-direct3d-shader-bytecode). That’s why I decided to compile the expressions to HLSL.The code in this directory does just that.The parser does not produce the complete expression tree. It only parses 2 things: variables, and function calls. The rest of the code is left in strings.That’s simpler and therefore faster than parsing into full-blown expression trees, but still enough to deduce variable types reasonably well.In original code there were no types, everything was 80-bit floats. GPUs only have 64-bit floats, they’re limited, and relatively slow to operate, I wanted to use faster 32-bit types as much as possible.
