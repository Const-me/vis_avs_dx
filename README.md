## Notes

What follows is a reformatted copy from the original `readme.txt` which came with the source code.

> [DrO](http://forums.winamp.com/member.php?s=&action=getinfo&userid=122037) has updated v2.81b to v2.81d by changing a few files, as he posted [here](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=2054764#post2054764)  

> This file you have here is the sourcecode from [nullsoft.com](http://www.nullsoft.com/free/avs/) (v2.81b), with the few files from [vis_avs_changed.zip](http://www.nunzioweb.com/daz/temp/avs/vis_avs_changed.zip) (2.81d) overwritten over v2.81b  

> Since DrO's download location sais that it's temporary, I've put this file up as a backup for his server and to have a complete file.  

> If you have questions or comments, the AVS forums are over [here](http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=85)  

> Keep in mind though, that there is currently only little, if any, development going on over there. If you have suggestions, your best chances are to make a start and post your results there with your questions, rather than to ask 'us' to do it, as none of  us are Nullsoft employees.  

> You'll also need the Winamp SDK. Search the forums for the lastest version.
