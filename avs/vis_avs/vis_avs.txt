Nullsoft Advanced Visualization Studio (AVS) v2.0a4 README
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

TODO: write readme here :)

Thanks to Paul Holden for the FunkyFX Firewurx APE  

Once you install this baby, fire up Winamp, open up the preferences 
(CTRL+P), go to the Plugins/Visualization section, and select 
Nullsoft AVS as the visualization plug-in. Hit start. 

Once the AVS opens, it will probably be showing a nice black output.
To get AVS to display something more interesting, hit space, or right
click in the black area and select a preset to load.

If you want to create your own presets, click the left mouse button in 
the black area of the window to bring up the AVS Editor window.

The editor lets you create new visuals by adding effects from your Effect
Library (in the upper right) to the Active Effect list (on the left side).
Once you've added effects, you can configure each effect by selecting them
from the Active Effect list. You can also clear the list, or load or save
the list to be loaded later as a preset. 

You can also configure some of AVS's settings by selecting items from the 
Settings section of the Editor. 

Hotkeys for main window:
 *  Any winamp key
 *  R toggles randomswitching
 *  F toggles fullscreen framerate counter
 *  Y and U cycle through presets in order
 *  Space goes to random preset
 *  Enter toggles fullscreen
 *  0,1-9, F1-F10 load presets
 *  Ctrl+above save presets

That's it for now, and enjoy!

1.5a1:
- deadbeef: made new effect system completely hiererchical and scaleable. 
			reorganized code a lot. cleaned things up. made it nice.

1.0a53:
- deadbeef: superscope effect
			made it save to plugins\vis_avs.dat, instead.

a52:
- deadbeef: optimized/simplified evallib. made it limited to 8 char variable names,
			32 variables max.
			improved ddm effect.
			improved color clip effect

a51:
- deadbeef:	optimized mosaic, grain, brightness, and bump effects
			optimized and added more functionality to interleave effect
- lone :	clear - fixed 'first frame only'
			eval - added sigmoid, sign, max, min, rand, band, bor, bnot, if, equal, above, below
			ddm  - added code for init and beat
			bump - added 'bi' var to control bump intensity thru exps.
			     - added depth source

						 - better confidence calculation
						 - added option to predict beats only if bpm has been found
						 - fixed relearn/adapt on new song option

				 brightness - now works actually like a brightness filter (bit slower tho)
				 text - fixed crash when window is smaller than width/height of text and random mode was checked
				 bump - added invert depth
				      - fixed exclusive use of eval lib, was choking with misc trans/custom
							  or additional bump effects, now saves/restores vars in a clean way.
							- changed 0-100 range to 0-1 which is much easier to use with math exps
							  (for backward compatibility, old settings are still using the old range)
